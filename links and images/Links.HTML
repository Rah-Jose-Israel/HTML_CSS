        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>This example is about links and <a href="Images.HTml"> images</a>.</p>
        <p>This particular page is about the absolute, relative, and root-relative links three kinds of links.</p>
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla
                Developer Network</a>, “scheme” (typically http:// or https://), followed by the domain name of the
            website, then the path of the target web page.
        </li>
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
               target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
               resource for web developers.</li>

        
        <li>“Relative” links point to another file in your we
            bsite from the vantage point of the file youre editing <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
                page </a> or dir path to file "misc/other-folder/extras.html.</li>
        <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
        <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
            but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
